    <p>“Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum&quot; - Rene Descartes </p>
    <em>Dubito</em>
    <p>Well, so it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, yet here we are at a singularity — indeed, life is full of wonders. Over the rather monotone summer, rife with undeniably emptiness, I came to a revelation to jot down a couple of things here and there. Be assured, however, that I am unaware of what I will write. At the moment, it really is a nagging concern that this website has become a hodge-podge of a baffling array of things (studying, life, writing, cs). It most likely is best that I focus on a single thing in  particular for a website like this. </p>
    <p>Ah, so we have reached <em>dubito.</em> </p>
    <em>Cogito </em>

    <p>Hello dear  </p>
    <p>You can probably tell that I am a bit bored. I may even know you irl and you may know me, but maybe not, and so who cares :) I can only wonder what brought you here (it&#39;s quite embarassing actually). Nonetheless, let&#39;s continue. </p>
    <p>I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003 with one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. By all means, being born in two different years isn&#39;t the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean / American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, it differs by 2 for me. </p>
    <p>Thus, <em>cogito.</em> </p>
    <em>Sum </em>
    <p>My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am pretty satisfied to have gone as far as I have over a short span of time, especially in competitive programming where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. It is interesting to note that I seem to be a victim of the initial stages of the dunning-kruger effect but from right to left, not left to right.  </p>
    <p>As with all things, with more time spent attempting to accept any such cognitive bias, I found myself having become quite decent in competitive programming. Becoming used to algorithmic reasoning and encountering applications, cs to this day interests me. </p>
    <p>$\exists{\textrm{human}} \notin \textrm{humans}$. </p>
    <p>No worries though, I am full of surprises?  </p>
    <em>Sum.</em>
